I'm Sandipan Ray. I'm a second-year computer science student who has a strong interest in both artificial intelligence and web development. I love learning new things and constantly exploring various subjects, whether it's the latest technology trends or delving into the world of literature. Writing allows me to express my ideas and share my experiences with others.

Creating and innovating excite me, especially when it comes to coding. I enjoy the challenge of solving problems and I'm always eager to expand my skill set by adding new tools and techniques.
